# TIC-TAC-TOE MF

This one is super simple and minimalistic. 
I wanted to create a tic tac toe game utilizing pygame, over all it took me about 2 hours to complete and 127 lines of code. 

I was encountering bugs where as soon as I tried to click on the screen to start the game, it would crash and close. I discovered I had a typo in my code in the loop to draw my x's. That 
was the bug that stumped me the hardest. Other than that, stack overflow and chatgpt were more than what I needed to accomplish my goal of creating a basic tic tac toe game. Enjoy!
