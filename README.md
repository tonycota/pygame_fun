Repo to play around with pygame dependency while I'm stuck at the airport

## Bored on an airplane, so I'm editing this README.
  Recently discovered about this dependency called pygame where I can create simple games in pythonic code. 
So here you'll see me creating a series of directories, where within each of them there will be different files containing their own games. Enjoy, this is strictly practice for me to continue excercising my code.

# To implement on your local machine:
simply just pip install pygame in the dev environment in the terminal and wham bam in the clam you're all good to go.
